## What is Mushroom dashboard strategy?

Mushroom dashboard strategy provides a strategy for Home assistant to automatically create a dashboard using Mushroom
cards, the area configuration and entity configuration.

My goal is to propose a way to create powerful dashboards without the need of spending hours manually creating them.

**Note:** This is my first javascript code and GitHub repository. Any recommendations are always welcome.

### Features

- üõ† Automatically create dashboard with three lines of yaml.
- üòç Built-in Views for device-specific controls.
- üé® Many options to customize to fit your needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to install these cards before using this strategy:

- [Mushroom cards][mushroomUrl]
- [Mini graph card][mini-graphUrl]

### HACS

Mushroom dashboard strategy is available in [HACS][hacsUrl] (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. Install HACS if you don't have it already.
2. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
3. Go to the "Frontend" section.
4. Click the button with the "+" icon
5. Search for "Mushroom dashboard" and install.

### Manual

1. Download `mushroom-strategy.js` file from
   the [`dist`](https://github.com/AalianKhan/mushroom-strategy/tree/main/dist) directory.
2. Put `mushroom-strategy.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add a reference to `mushroom-strategy.js` in Dashboard.
   There are two ways to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_
      as `/local/mushroom-strategy.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add the following code to the `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/mushroom-strategy.js
              type: module
        ```

## Usage

All the rounded cards can be configured using the Dashboard UI editor.

1. In the UI of the dashboard, click the three dots in the top right corner.
2. Click _Edit Dashboard_.
3. Click 3 dots again
4. Click `Raw configuration editor`
5. Add the following lines:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:mushroom-strategy
views: []
```

### Hidding specific entities

When creating this dashboard for the first time, you probably have many entities that you don't want to see.

You can hide these entities by following the steps below:

1. Click and hold the entity
2. Click the `cog icon` in the top right corner of the popup.
3. Set `Visible` to `off`.

The view should update when the page is refreshed.

If you don't want to hide the entity from all dashboards, you can use [Card Options](#card-options) to hide specific
entities and devices.

![Views](./docs/Hidden.png)

### Adding devices to areas

You can add devices to an area by going to `Settings` found at the bottom of the sidebar.

1. Click `Devices and integration`
2. Select the integration of your device
3. Click the device you wish to add
4. Click the `pencil icon` found in the top right corner
5. Enter an area in area field.

You can also set an entity of that device to a different area by going to the advanced settings of that entity.

If you created an entity in your `configuration.yaml` you may need to enter a `unique_id` first before you set an area
to it.
See [docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/unique_id/)

## Strategy options

You can set strategy options to further customize the dashboard.
By default, all views are enabled which include lights, fans, covers, switches, climates and cameras. All chips are also
enabled which count the number of devices on for the platforms light, fan, cover and climate. It also auto-selects a
weather entity for the weather chip.

The options available are:

#### Example

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:mushroom-strategy
  options:
    areas:
      family_room_id:
        name: Family Room
        icon: mdi:television
        icon_color: green
        order: 1
        extra_cards:
          - type: custom:mushroom-chips-card
            chips:
              - type: entity
                entity: sensor.family_room_temperature
                icon: mdi:thermometer
                icon_color: pink
            alignment: center
      kitchen_id:
        name: Kitchen
        icon: mdi:silverware-fork-knife
        icon_color: red
        order: 2
      garage_id:
        hidden: true
      hallway_id:
        type: HaAreaCard
views: []
```

#### Undisclosed Area

The strategy has a special area, named `undisclosed`.
This area is enabled by default and includes the entities that aren't linked to any Home Assistant area.

The area can be configured like any other area as described above.
To exclude this area from the dashboard and views, set its property `hidden` to `true`.

#### Setting options for all areas

Use `_` as an identifier to set the options for all areas.

The following example sets the type of all area-cards to Home Assistant's area card:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:mushroom-strategy
  options:
    areas:
      _:
        type: HaAreaCard
views: []
```

### Card Options

The `card_options` entry enables you to specify a card type for an entity or to hide the card from the dashboard.
You can also provide a device ID and hide all entities linked to that device.
See [Instructions on to find a device ID](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/device-id-entity-id-where-to-find/289230/4?u=aaliankhan).

#### Example

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:mushroom-strategy
  options:
    card_options:
      fan.master_bedroom_fan:
        type: custom:mushroom-fan-card
      remote.harmony_hub_wk:
        hidden: true
      077ba0492c9bb3b31ffac34f1f3a626a:
        hidden: true

views: []
```

### Pre-built views

![Light Views](./docs/light_view.png)

Mushroom strategy includes pre-built views to control/view specific domains.
All devices that are in an area where `hidden` is set to false/undefined are shown*.

By default, all pre-built views below are shown:

```

### Chips

![Chips](./docs/chips.png)

Mushroom strategy has chips that indicate the number of devices which are active for a specific domain.
All devices that are in an area where `hidden` is set to false/undefined are counted.
By default, all chips are enabled.

You can manually configure a weather entity-id to use, and there's also an option to add
more [Mushroom Chips][mushroom-chipsUrl] using `extra_chips`.

**Note: To hide the weather chip, you should hide or disable the entity itself.**

| Available chips  | type              | Description                                                                                                    |

| `light_count`    | boolean           | Chip to display the number of lights on, tapping turns off all lights, holding navigates to lights view.       |
| `fan_count`      | boolean           | Chip to display the number of fans on, tapping turns off all fans, holding navigates to fans view.             |
